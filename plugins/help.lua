Hello *%s* üëãüèº, nice to meet you!
I'm Group Butler, the first administration bot using the official Bot API.

*I can do a lot of cool stuffs*, here's a short list:
‚Ä¢ I can *kick or ban* users
‚Ä¢ You can use me to set the group rules
‚Ä¢ I have a flexible *anti-flood* system
‚Ä¢ I can *welcome new users* with a customizable message, or if you want with a gif or a sticker
‚Ä¢ I can *warn* users, and ban them when they reach the maximum number of warnings
‚Ä¢ I can also warn, kick or ban users when they post a specific media
‚Ä¶and more, below you can find the "all commands" button to get the whole list!

I work better if you add me to the group administrators (otherwise I won't be able to kick or ban)!

For a correct use of the markdown, check [this post](https://telegram.me/GroupButler_ch/46) in the channel

`/setlink [link|-]`: set the group link, so it can be re-called by other admins, or unset it.
If you are going to use it in a public supergroup, you do not need to write the group link. Just write `/setlink`
`/link`: get the group link, if already set.
`/msglink`: get the link to a message. Works only in public supergroups

*Note*: the bot can recognize valid group links. If a link is not valid, you won't receive a reply.

*Arab*: when Arab it's not allowed (üö´), everyone who will write an arab character will be kicked from the group.
*Rtl*: it stands for 'Righ To Left' character, and it's the responsible of the weird service messages that are written in the opposite sense.

Anyway, translations are open to everyone. If you want to translate the bot, see an [information](https://github.com/RememberTheAir/GroupButler#translators) on GitHub.
You can use `/strings` command to get the `.po` file of your language, and translate it
